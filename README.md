# EcoMon
EcoMon is an environmental monitoring system that is partially built.  It uses PHP to log information in a SQL database managed by PhpMyAdmin via XAMPP. To state clearly, the project was underdeveloped however provides a relativley straightfoward user interface to manage records.

If this project had more time and effort dedicated during development by all team members, this system could retrive data from the SQL database fed directly from industrial controllers and external hardware.

The basis of the idea was to use temprature monitor modules attached to a raspberry pi device, via ethernet or wi-fi connected using an anntenna to transmit information over a local server into an SQL database. This current project for example, provides only the front end for the user.
